      This editor window will open itself whenever you open this project. To get
      rid of it, simply delete the "Readme" file provided with this package.

    text: 'This is likely due to a shader issue.



      This means the rendering
      pipeline of your project is not the same as the default one on our package.
      This is easily fixable by going to "Assets/Piloto Studio/Shaders" and double-clicking
      on whichever .unitypackage file matches your rendering pipeline.



      Keep
      in mind that for those files to be there, you''ll need our free Shaders package.
      When you downloaded this package, you got a popup to download dependencies,
      which contains all the shaders upgrades. If you refused to download the dependencies,
      you can either re-import the package from the package manager or get the pack
      from the link below:

    text: 'If you are using the standard rendering pipeline, make sure the Core Rendering
      Pipeline package is uninstalled.



      If you are using either HDRP or URP,
      make sure the Core Rendering Pipeline package is installed.



      This is
      a base package made by Unity.



      To do this, go to the package manager
      and search for "Core Rendering Pipeline" and install/uninstall it accordingly.



      Also,
      make sure your rendering pipeline asset is NOT a 2D variant. We do not offer
      official support for 2D games unless stated otherwise on the store page.'

      we also give out free vouchers for our other packs to those who have verified
      reviews on our packs. We have limited vouchers, and they''re given out on first-come
      first served basis.
